As scientific research becomes increasingly complex and data-intensive, researchers face growing technical barriers that limit accessibility and efficiency. *SciSciGPT* addresses these challenges by leveraging recent advances in large language models and AI agents to create a comprehensive research assistant.

The system offers both a **public chat interface** at [sciscigpt.com](https://sciscigpt.com) and a **fully open-source implementation** on GitHub. *SciSciGPT* integrates multiple research capabilities: retrieving relevant SciSci publications, extracting data from complex databases, conducting advanced analytics, creating visualizations, and evaluating its own outputs. This seamless AI-powered workflow lowers technical barriers, enhances research efficiency, and enables new modes of human-AI collaboration.



---

## Overview

*SciSciGPT* is a multi-agent AI system that includes a *ResearchManager* and four specialist agents, each designed to handle distinct aspects of the science of science research process:

The system comprises five specialized agents:

- ***ResearchManager*** - Orchestrates workflows by breaking complex questions into tasks and coordinating specialist agents
- ***LiteratureSpecialist*** - Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to process SciSci publications with metadata filters and progressive analysis of abstracts, methodology, and results
- ***DatabaseSpecialist*** - Navigates the SciSci data lake using SQL tools and embedding-based entity matching to extract and preprocess scholarly data
- ***AnalyticsSpecialist*** - Conducts analysis using Python, R, and Julia in isolated sandboxes to generate insights and visualizations
- ***EvaluationSpecialist*** - Performs multi-level quality assessments of tools, visualizations, and workflows, assigning reward scores to guide system improvements and ensure reliable research outputs

---

## Backend Architecture

**Software Service Ecosystem:** The *SciSciGPT* backend is built on a comprehensive software stack that integrates multiple services and technologies to enable seamless AI-powered research workflows. The entire *SciSciGPT* system is developed and deployed on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Anaconda 2025.06 version, providing a robust foundation for multi-agent coordination and scientific computing.

### Core Infrastructure

- **AI Orchestration**: [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) & [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) for multi-agent workflow coordination
- **LLM Provider**: [Google Cloud Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) with Claude models (Anthropic)
- **Text Embedding**: Text embeddings for vector search in *LiteratureSpecialist* and *DatabaseSpecialist*
- **Application Framework**: FastAPI with [LangServe](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve) for API endpoints

### Data & Storage Services

- **Vector Database**: [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) for semantic search in RAG
- **Relational Database**: [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) for hosting SciSci scholarly relational database

- **Storage**: 100GB+ for dependencies and datasets
- **Network**: Internet connection for API calls to LLM providers

---

## Backend Setup Guideline

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Our dependency installation is divided into two parts:

##### Minimal Setup (Required)

The minimal setup is based on [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) and includes only the essential packages needed to launch and run *SciSciGPT*, including LangChain-related packages for agent orchestration, Google BigQuery client libraries for database access, Pinecone client for vector database operations, and R and Julia environments configured via conda-forge.

Within the Anaconda environment, the *AnalyticsSpecialist* uses a unified [jupyter_client](backend/func/jupyter.py) interface with rpy2 and juliacall, which allows the *AnalyticsSpecialist* to execute R and Julia code within the same Python-based environment, enabling seamless multi-language scientific computing. Completing Part 1 is sufficient to get *SciSciGPT* up and running.

To install the minimal dependencies, navigate to the backend directory and run:

```bash
cd backend

conda create -n sciscigpt python=3.11 -y
conda activate sciscigpt

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install R using conda-forge
conda install -c conda-forge r-essentials r-base -y
conda install rpy2 -y

# Install Julia using conda-forge
conda install -c conda-forge julia -y
pip install juliacall
```

##### Comprehensive Package Installation (Optional)

The second part aims to ensure the *AnalyticsSpecialist* can handle a wide variety of computational tasks. Since the *AnalyticsSpecialist* may generate arbitrary code during execution, we want to minimize the likelihood of runtime failures due to missing packages. Therefore, we install a comprehensive collection of Python, R, and Julia packages that cover most common scientific computing scenarios.

For users who simply want to verify that *SciSciGPT*'s architecture works correctly or for demonstration purposes, Part 2 dependencies are optional. However, for production use where the *AnalyticsSpecialist* needs to handle diverse analytical tasks, installing the full dependency set is recommended.

To install the comprehensive dependencies, navigate to the backend directory and run:

```bash
cd backend
bash setup-sandbox.sh
```

This script will automatically install all packages within the existing `sciscigpt` environment:

- Python packages from `requirements-sandbox-python.txt`
- R packages from `requirements-sandbox-r.R`
- Julia packages from `requirements-sandbox-julia.jl`

------

### Step 2: Configure Google Cloud Platform

*SciSciGPT* leverages three core Google Cloud Platform services to provide comprehensive research capabilities:

- **Vertex AI** provides the backbone LLM API service, enabling *SciSciGPT* to utilize Anthropic Claude models through Google's Vertex AI platform for natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation across all specialist agents
- **BigQuery** serves as the data warehouse for SciSciNet, allowing *SciSciGPT*'s *DatabaseSpecialist* to view, read, and execute SQL queries against large-scale scholarly datasets containing publications, citations, authors, and institutional data
- **Cloud Storage** hosts and manages file artifacts including BigQuery query results, *AnalyticsSpecialist*'s intermediate computational outputs, and generated visualizations, enabling seamless file communication between frontend and backend systems through public URLs

**GCP Project:** Create a Google Cloud Platform Project (`GCP_PROJECT_ID`)

**BigQuery Database:** Enable the [BigQuery API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest) in your GCP project and create a BigQuery dataset (`BIGQUERY_DATASET_ID`) to store your SciSci research data.

**Cloud Storage:**

1. Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket (`GCS_BUCKET_NAME`) in your GCP project
2. Configure the bucket for public access (refer to [Make data public](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/making-data-public) for more details):
   - Go to Cloud Storage > Browser in GCP Console
   - Select your bucket > Permissions tab
   - Add principal: `allUsers` and assign role: `Storage Object Viewer`
3. Files, including SQL query results, intermediate outputs, and visualizations will be uploaded to GCS and served via public URLs

**Vertex AI:** Enable the [Vertex AI API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest) in `GCP_PROJECT_ID` project and enable Anthropic Claude models (for example, `claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022`) of required version in Vertex AI's Model Garden.

**Service Account: **Create a service account (refer to [Create service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create)) and grant the necessary IAM roles (refer to [Grant an IAM role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console)). The service account requires the following roles:

- `BigQuery Data Viewer`: Permission to read datasets and tables in Google BigQuery;
- `BigQuery Job User`: Permission to create query jobs in Google BigQuery API;
- `BigQuery Read Session User`: Permission to use BigQuery Storage API;
- `Storage Object Admin`: Permissions for file read and uploads for GCS bucket;
- `Vertex AI User`: Permission for LLM querying and textual embedding;

Then, create and download the service account [JSON credential key file](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-list-get), and save as `.google_application_credentials.json` in the `backend` directory, should be in the format of the example `google_application_credentials.json` key.

---

### Step 3: Configure Vector Database

*SciSciGPT* uses Pinecone as a vector database to host the SciSciCorpus, a comprehensive collection of scientific literature. The corpus is indexed using vector embeddings to enable semantic search capabilities, allowing the *LiteratureSpecialist* agent to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) operations for Science of Science research. Moreover, *SciSciGPT* uses Pinecone as a vector database to host standardized institution and field names from SciSciNet, enabling semantic search capabilities for name disambiguation and standardization. This allows the *DatabaseSpecialist* agent to perform fuzzy matching and find the most appropriate standardized names when users provide variations or partial matches.

**Setup Steps**

1. Create a Pinecone account at https://www.pinecone.io;
2. Create an index named `NAME_SEARCH_INDEX` with the following configuration:
   - Dimensions: 1536 (compatible with OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model)
   - Metric: Cosine similarity
3. Create an index named `SCISCICORPUS_INDEX` with the following configuration:
   - Dimensions: 3072 (compatible with OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model)
   - Metric: Cosine similarity
4. Generate a Pinecone API key with full permissions from your Pinecone dashboard ([Manage API keys](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/projects/manage-api-keys));
5. Obtain an OpenAI API key for text embedding generation ([OpenAI API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)).

---

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Within the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file using `.env.example` as template:

```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=.google_application_credentials.json
GOOGLE_BIGQUERY_URI=bigquery://GCP_PROJECT_ID/BIGQUERY_DATASET_ID

LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH=/tmp/sandbox
GCS_BUCKET_NAME=GCS_BUCKET_NAME
GCS_BUCKET_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/GCS_BUCKET_NAME

PINECONE_API_KEY=PINECONE_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=OPENAI_API_KEY
SCISCICORPUS_INDEX=SCISCICORPUS_INDEX
SCISCICORPUS_NAMESPACE=SCISCICORPUS_NAMESPACE
NAME_SEARCH_INDEX=NAME_SEARCH_INDEX
```

---

### Step 5: Construct Databases

#### SciSciNet Relational Database

Execute the `backend/SciSciNet-Relational.ipynb` notebook, which will automatically download all SciSciNet tables from the [SciSciGPT-SciSciNet HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ErzhuoShao/SciSciGPT-SciSciNet) and upload them to Google BigQuery with proper schema definitions, table descriptions, and column descriptions. The final dataset comprises 19 comprehensive tables: `authors`, `fields`, `institutions`, `nct`, `newsfeed`, `nih`, `nsf`, `paper_author_affiliations`, `paper_citations`, `paper_fields`, `paper_nct`, `paper_newsfeed`, `paper_nih`, `paper_nsf`, `paper_patents`, `paper_twitter`, `papers`, `patents`, and `twitter`. This collection provides extensive coverage of the innovation ecosystem, enabling comprehensive Science of Science research capabilities.

#### SciSciNet Vector Database

Execute the `backend/SciSciNet-Vector.ipynb` notebook, which will automatically download the `fields` and `institutions` tables from the SciSciNet [SciSciGPT-SciSciNet HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ErzhuoShao/SciSciGPT-SciSciNet). The notebook will automatically generate embeddings for `field_name` and `institution_name` using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model, indexing each entity with its embedding vector along with other metadata. The resulting `NAME_SEARCH_INDEX` vector database serves the name disambiguation and standardization capabilities of the *DatabaseSpecialist*.

#### SciSciCorpus Vector Database

Execute the `backend/SciSciCorpus.ipynb` notebook to build your vector database. The notebook downloads the SciSciCorpus dataset from the [SciSciGPT-SciSciCorpus HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ErzhuoShao/SciSciGPT-SciSciCorpus), generates vector embeddings for research paper abstracts using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model, indexes each document with its embedding vector along with metadata like full textual content and bibliometric information, and uploads the indexed data to your Pinecone vector database. The resulting `SCISCICORPUS_INDEX` vector database will contain semantically searchable scientific literature with associated metadata, enabling the *LiteratureSpecialist* to perform sophisticated RAG-based research queries and literature discovery.

------

### Step 6: Run the Backend

Deploy the Backend of *SciSciGPT*:

```bash
bash start.sh
```

The API will be available at:

- LangServe API endpoints: `http://localhost:8080`
- Main *SciSciGPT* agent: `http://localhost:8080/sciscigpt`
- Individual tools: `http://localhost:8080/redoc`

The backend implements *SciSciGPT* and using langserve to package *SciSciGPT*'s agent as an FastAPI which could be connect and invoked remotely using Langserve and support event streaming. `http://localhost:8080/sciscigpt` include the entry of the main *SciSciGPT* agent, while the entries of all other tools could be found at `http://localhost:8080/redoc`.

---

## Frontend Architecture

**Software Service Ecosystem:** This is the frontend for *SciSciGPT*, an advanced LLM agent research assistant for the field of science of science (SciSci). This project is adapted from the [Vercel AI Chatbot](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot) and is designed to be integrated with a LLM agent API backend supported by LangServe.

**Features:**

- User-friendly interface for interacting with the *SciSciGPT* agent
- Designed to connect with a LangServe-powered backend for LLM agent capabilities
- Streaming output from *SciSciGPT* with live response updates
- Accessing and downloading generated research materials
- Downloading generated artifacts including tables, code outputs, and visualizations
- Chat history management with persistent conversation

---

## Frontend Setup Guideline

### Step 1: Create KV Database

Create a Redis KV database using Upstash at https://console.upstash.com/redis. The frontend code will automatically handle user authentication and chat history management. *SciSciGPT* uses Upstash's Redis database, which provides a hash table-based database for storing and retrieving information based on user ID and chat history ID.

Follow these steps:

1. Visit https://console.upstash.com/redis and create a new Redis database
2. Obtain the API credentials (URL and token) from your Upstash dashboard

---

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Update your environment variables (`KV_URL`, `KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`) in the `.env.local` file (using `.env.example` as a template) with the credentials provided by Upstash

2. Set up the LangServe backend API endpoint:
   - `LANGSERVE_URL`: The URL where your LangServe backend is running (default: `http://localhost:8080/sciscigpt` for local development)
   - `LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH`: The local path of the workspace of *SciSciGPT*, which should be aligned with the configuration of backend

3. Configure authentication and deployment URLs:
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Secret key for NextAuth.js authentication (default: `sciscigpt`)
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The URL where your frontend will be deployed (default: `http://localhost:3000` for local development)
   - For production deployment, update to your actual domain: `https://your-domain.com`

``````bash
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
KV_REST_API_TOKEN="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
KV_REST_API_URL="https://abcde-fghij-12345.upstash.io"
KV_URL="redis://default:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@abcde-fghij-12345.upstash.io:1234"

LANGSERVE_URL="http://localhost:8080/sciscigpt"
LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH="/tmp/sandbox"

NEXTAUTH_SECRET="sciscigpt"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

ENABLE_REDIRECT="false"
REDIRECT_TARGET="https://localhost:3000"
``````

---

### Step 3: Setup Node.js Environment

Install Node.js and pnpm, and all other required packages (in `frontend/package.json`) within `sciscigpt` environment using conda-forge.

```bash
cd frontend
bash setup.sh
```

---

### Step 4: Run the Frontend

Deploy *SciSciGPT* Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
bash start.sh
```

The user chat interface will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Trouble Shooting in Setup

### Common Configuration Issues

#### Package Version Requirements

> **Important**: Do not modify the versions of packages that are explicitly specified in `backend/requirements.txt` and `frontend/package.json`. These version constraints are critical for system stability:

**Changing of BigQuery-related packages versions** may cause loss of access to BigQuery databases, incomplete table displays (especially missing table column descriptions), and DatabaseSpecialist functionality failures. **Modifying Pinecone package** versions may result in the vector database connection issues or formatting issues and cause malfunctions of name search tool and literature search tool. For packages without explicit version constraints, versions can be adjusted based on your system requirements and compatibility needs.

If the DatabaseSpecialist is not functioning properly, verify that **Google BigQuery Service Account** has proper IAM permissions, which should at least include all IAM roles mentioned above. Also, ensure that the `.google_application_credentials.json` of the corresponding roles is properly placed in the backend directory.

**Google Cloud Storage Configuration:** Ensure that your Google Cloud Storage bucket has public access enabled by granting access to `allUsers` for your storage bucket, which allows the frontend to display figures generated by SciSciGPT backend via public URLs, enables download links for generated tables and results, and without public access, generated visualizations and downloadable content will not be accessible from the frontend.

**LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH Configuration:** Ensure that the `LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH` environment variable is set to the same path in both the frontend and backend configurations. This synchronization is critical for proper file sharing and workspace management between the frontend interface and backend processing components.

------

## Operating System Compatibility

*SciSciGPT* dependencies are built on [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/), the setup processes described above can be replicated across different operating systems. We have successfully tested the above installation procedures and run successfully on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, CentOS Stream 10, macOS Sequoia 15.5, and Windows 11 using Anaconda. *SciSciGPT* operates normally across these tested platforms.
